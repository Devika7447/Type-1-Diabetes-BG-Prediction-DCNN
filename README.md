# Type-1-Diabetes-BG-Prediction-DCNN

Predicting blood glucose levels in Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is of utmost importance due to its direct impact on patient safety, long-term health, and overall quality of life. Maintaining blood sugar within a safe range is critical for preventing life-threatening complications and improving daily diabetes management. One of the most immediate concerns in T1D is preventing hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). Predicting glucose levels enables timely interventions, such as consuming carbohydrates to prevent a sugar crash or adjusting insulin doses to avoid dangerous spikes.

Accurate blood glucose prediction in Type 1 diabetes is essential for preventing long-term complications such as nerve damage, kidney failure, heart disease, and blindness by maintaining better glycemic control. 

Since glucose levels are influenced by multiple factors like diet, stress, and exercise, predictive models help reduce the mental and physical burden on patients and caregivers by providing automated assistance.

## üö©DILATED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK MODEL

A Dilated Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is a variation of the traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to capture larger receptive fields (the region of input that influences a particular output).Dilated convolutions increase the receptive field(how many previous glucose readings a neuron can use to make a prediction.) without increasing the kernel size or adding more layers. This is useful for time-series data like glucose levels, where long-term dependencies are key. 

## üöÄ Features
- **Deep Learning-Based Prediction**: Utilizes DCNN to capture complex glucose variation patterns.
- **Multi-Source Data Integration**: Combines blood glucose readings, insulin intake, carbohydrate consumption, and activity levels.
- **Advanced Data Preprocessing**: Merges multiple CSV datasets, handles missing values, and applies feature engineering.
- **Customizable Model Parameters**: Supports hyperparameter tuning (batch size, epochs, learning rate).
- **Performance Evaluation**: Measures accuracy using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**.

**üìä About The Dataset : HUPA-UCM DIABETES DATASET**

The dataset consists of multiple CSV files, each named with an identifier (e.g., "HUPA0001P.csv" to "HUPA0028P.csv"). These represent individual patient records or data segments.


**Summary of the Data:**

- Time-based dataset: Each row represents a timestamped health measurement.
- Glucose levels: Monitors blood glucose over time.
- Physical activity: Tracks calories burned and steps taken.
- Heart rate: Records fluctuations in heart rate.
- Insulin management: Captures basal insulin rate and bolus insulin delivery.
- Dietary intake: Logs carbohydrate consumption.
